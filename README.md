# Belly Button Challenge
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this challenge I have created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample and a tab to display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

I have attachecd a screenshot of Belly Button Dashbard,
