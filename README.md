# Belly Button Challenge
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In this challenge I have created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample and a tab to display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

I have attachecd a screenshot of Belly Button Dashbard,

2. In my JavaScript code, I have used the functionality of the d3 library, utilizing its json() method to handle data retrieval, employing the find() function to filter and extract and incorporating the .reverse() method to invert the order of elements as required.
[.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find),
